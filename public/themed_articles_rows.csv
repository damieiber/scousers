En sus primeras palabras como máximo dirigente, Di Carlo fijó rápidamente una postura crítica sobre la actualidad del primer equipo. El nuevo presidente señaló duramente que el desempeño del conjunto dirigido por Marcelo Gallardo ""no nos representa"", una declaración que exige un cambio inmediato. No obstante, también delineó la filosofía de su gestión, instando a la calma al manifestar que la institución debe encarar el futuro con ""templanza y fe"", siempre recordando que el ""objetivo histórico"" del club es la consecución de resultados deportivos, un foco que, según indicó, no debe perderse de vista.",f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479,2025-11-04 03:34:37.201+00,2025-11-04 03:34:38.064779+00,2025-11-04 03:34:38.064779+00,"El nuevo presidente de River Plate no esperó para marcar la cancha.

5dd4d197-a1a8-4d40-986f-b980ed74a857,Elección y Asunción de Stefano Di Carlo en River,"Stefano Di Carlo fue electo como el nuevo presidente de River Plate en una jornada electoral histórica. Los comicios registraron una participación récord de más de 25 mil socios, la mayor de la historia del club. Di Carlo se impuso de manera contundente, obteniendo un amplio triunfo con el 61% de los votos, lo que lo consolidó como el candidato más votado en la historia de la institución.

Di Carlo asumió formalmente la presidencia de la entidad de Núñez con un mandato que se extenderá hasta 2029, marcando el inicio de una nueva etapa. En sus primeras declaraciones como mandatario, el foco se centró en la necesidad de recuperar la excelencia deportiva. Declaró que “volver a obtener resultados deportivos es nuestra prioridad absoluta” y que “no debemos perder de vista nuestro objetivo histórico”.

El nuevo presidente fue crítico con la actualidad del primer equipo, incluso bajo la gestión anterior de Gallardo, al afirmar categóricamente que el presente del River “no nos representa”. Entre sus promesas de campaña, que ahora deberá ejecutar, se destacan proyectos ambiciosos como la instalación de un techo para el Estadio Monumental y la expansión global de la marca River, y llamó a la afición a encarar la nueva gestión con “templanza y fe”.",f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479,2025-11-04 03:16:37.688+00,2025-11-04 03:16:38.758595+00,2025-11-04 03:34:28.266+00,"River inicia una nueva era institucional con un mandato claro: el retorno inmediato a la excelencia deportiva.
